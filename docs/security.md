# Security and Compliance Considerations (Especially Regarding Access to Tenant Usage Data)

## Overview

Security and compliance are woven into every aspect of the platform. The design ensures tenant data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, aligning with enterprise and regulatory standards (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA-readiness). Isolation is preserved while monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.

## Security Architecture

### **Data in Transit and at Rest**

- **Encryption in Transit:**
    - All service-to-service and agent-to-collector communication uses TLS 1.2+.
    - Internal Kubernetes service mesh (e.g., Istio or AWS App Mesh) can enforce mTLS.

- **Encryption at Rest:**
    - All metrics, features, and recommendations stored in S3, DynamoDB, or RDS are encrypted using KMS-managed keys.
    - Disk encryption enabled for any persistent volumes.

---

### **Access Controls**

- **API Authentication & Authorization:**
    - All external API calls require strong authentication (JWT/OIDC/OAuth2) and are strictly authorized to their own tenantâ€™s data.
    - API Gateway and middleware enforce tenant context on every request.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - Kubernetes RBAC restricts agents and services to only namespaces and resources they should access.
- **IAM Least Privilege:**
    - Each microservice and agent uses narrowly scoped AWS IAM roles.
    - No sharing of credentials or cross-namespace secrets.

---

### **Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation**

- **Storage Segmentation:**
    - Data storage (S3 buckets/paths, DynamoDB partition keys, RDS schemas) is always partitioned by tenant.
- **Network Segmentation:**
    - Kubernetes NetworkPolicies or AWS Security Groups prevent pod-to-pod cross-tenant communication.
- **Isolation in Processing:**
    - Model inference and batch jobs either run per-tenant (separate processes) or ensure strict context-based input/output validation.

---

### **Auditability and Monitoring**

- **Audit Logging:**
    - Every API call, data access, and model recommendation is logged with tenant context (and user or service identity).
    - Logs are immutable, timestamped, and stored in secure, append-only storage (e.g., S3, CloudWatch Logs, or ELK stack).
- **Security Event Monitoring:**
    - Automated alerts for anomalous access patterns or privilege escalation attempts.
- **Regular Security Reviews:**
    - Scheduled penetration tests and code audits ensure controls remain effective as the platform evolves.

---

### **Regulatory Compliance Alignment**

- **Data Minimization:**
    - The platform collects only metrics required for infrastructure optimization; no application-level PII or sensitive business data is ever ingested.
- **Right to Be Forgotten:**
    - Per-tenant data retention and deletion policies respect regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Tenant-Initiated Data Deletion:**
    - APIs are available to trigger secure deletion of all tenant-specific data upon contract termination or request.
- **Supported Standards:**
    - Platform design aligns with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA (when configured as a covered entity).

### **Key Security Tools and Services**

| Function         | Service/Feature                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Encryption keys  | AWS KMS/Secrets Manager                  |
| API security     | OIDC/JWT, API Gateway (Auth), RBAC       |
| Audit logging    | CloudWatch Logs, ELK, S3 Versioning      |
| Multi-tenancy    | Namespace partitioning, IAM, DDB partkey |
| Pen Testing      | CI/CD Security Scans, 3rd-party audits   |

## Summary

- **Comprehensive, defense-in-depth approach:** Security is enforced at network, application, storage, and CI/CD layers.
- **Tenant data is always isolated, encrypted, and never accessible by other tenants.**
- **Compliance with leading regulatory standards is achievable and provable through audit logs, controls, and regular testing.**
