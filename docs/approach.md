# Approach to AI Integration and Chosen Techniques/Algorithms

## Overview

The AI-Powered Cloud Cost Optimization Platform integrates machine learning into a cloud-native architecture to analyze infrastructure usage, identify optimization opportunities, and surface actionable right-sizing recommendations for Kubernetes/EKS and AWS resources. The approach emphasizes modularity, explainability, and tenant security.

## Key Principles

- **AI-augmented, Not Autonomous:**  
  Recommendations are explainable with confidence scores, and reviewed by engineers before production change.

- **Data-Driven:**  
  All decisions are based on actual historical metrics from Prometheus, CloudWatch, and Cost & Usage Reports—not static rules.

- **Transparent & Explainable:**  
  Algorithms and outputs are designed to be auditable and understandable by humans.

- **Cloud-Native & Multi-Tenant:**  
  All data and computations are partitioned per tenant, following best practices for microservice deployment and GitOps lifecycle management.

## AI/ML Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Collection:**
    - Pod/node metrics are scraped via Prometheus exporters.
    - Cloud resource/cost metrics are fetched via AWS CloudWatch APIs.
    - Data is always tagged and partitioned by tenant.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - For each workload:
        - Compute p95, p99, mean, max of CPU/RAM usage.
        - Calculate burstiness, allocation-to-usage efficiency, and other relevant ratios.
    - Features are stored for ML model input and auditability.

3. **ML Model Selection:**
    - **Right-Sizing:**
        - **Quantile analysis** (e.g., p95 times a buffer) is used to recommend pod resource requests/limits.
        - Approach is simple, robust, and easily explainable.
    - **Pattern Recognition (Clustering):**
        - **K-Means** or **DBSCAN** is used to group workloads by resource profile (e.g., steady, bursty, idle).
        - This informs node group optimization and reservation suitability.
    - **Anomaly Detection:**
        - **Z-score (statistical thresholding)** detects resource/cost spikes.
        - Optionally, **Isolation Forest** if extended to Python/SageMaker in the future.
    - **(Planned Extension) Forecasting:**
        - **Holt-Winters/Prophet** for demand/usage trend forecasting as complexity grows.

4. **Serving & Explainability:**
    - All recommendations include:
        - **Confidence scores** (e.g., "p95 captures 95% of observed data").
        - **Rationale/explanation** (e.g., "p95 of last 30 days with 1.2x buffer").
    - Recommendations and the features used are stored and auditable.

## Why These Techniques?

- **Quantile/Percentile Analysis:**
    - Industry-standard for right-sizing in cloud-native workloads (simple, robust, widely understood).
    - Easily tuned for different workload risk tolerance.

- **Clustering:**
    - Identifies workload archetypes and outliers—helps reduce complexity and optimize at scale.
    - Used in leading cost optimization tools (Kubecost, AWS Compute Optimizer).

- **Z-score/Statistical Thresholds:**
    - Transparent and easy to justify to engineering and compliance teams.

- **Holt-Winters/Prophet (extension):**
    - Suitable for seasonality and demand prediction, if required later.

## Go (Golang) Implementation

- Quantile/statistical methods use [gonum/stat](https://github.com/gonum/gonum).
- Clustering via [gokmeans](https://github.com/mash/gokmeans) or similar.
- Complex models (if needed) can be accessed via a Python/SageMaker microservice.

## Integration Points

- **API:**  
  Pattern recognition and recommendation logic is a stateless REST microservice (Kubernetes/EKS deployable).
- **Data Ingestion:**  
  Scheduled/batch pipeline, triggered on metric availability.
- **Dashboard:**  
  Recommendation and explanatory data is exposed via REST endpoints, ready for dashboard or workflow integration.
